									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I acquired my Strava workout data and efficiently imported it into Jupyter Notebooks utilizing the powerful pandas library. With a focus on data wrangling and exploratory analysis, I delved into the dataset to gain valuable insights.</p>
									<p>To better understand the patterns and relationships within the data, I generated a range of informative visuals like box plots, bar plots, pair plots, and correlation plots using the seaborn and matplotlib libraries. The combination of these visualization tools allowed me to gain a comprehensive understanding of my running activities and uncover interesting trends in the data. </p>

									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project, I collected data from the Airbnb site specific to Cape Town, comprising 12 months of calendar archives and listing information. To begin, I used Excel to combine and clean the various datasets, ensuring that the tables were ready for analysis. Next, I imported the cleaned data into Tableau Public, where I conducted joins between the listing and calendar data. The join utilized was an inner join based on the listing ID.</p>

                                                 			<p>With the data prepared and merged, I proceeded to create several insightful visuals that I later combined into a dashboard. The visuals included "Average Price per Neighborhood," "Revenue per Year," "Average Price per Number of Bedrooms," and a map showcasing listings across different neighborhoods and their corresponding average prices. This allowed me to identify which areas were more costly and in higher demand, enabling me to assess the competition.</p>

									<p>Furthermore, I generated a count of distinct bedroom listings to gain a better understanding of the distribution of available bedrooms. This comprehensive analysis provided valuable insights into the Airbnb market in Cape Town and helped uncover pricing trends and demand patterns, facilitating better decision-making for future listings.</p>

									</a></h2>
									<p>In this project I worked on a public data set on a bike sale shop. The data consisted of buyer’s information such as marital status, if they have children  their educational level, if they have cars or own houses and their occupations.  Everything on this project was entirely done on Microsoft excel. We cleaned data then created a number of pivot tables that we later on converted into  insightful visuals some questions asked was what gender and age group tend to buy bikes more than others we  wanted to know their incomes and region they originated from and if the fact that they own cars and house as well as having children influenced the decision to buy a bike</p> 
									

									<p>Data Cleaning:
									To ensure the accuracy and reliability of our analysis, the first step involved data cleaning. This process aimed to rectify any errors, inconsistencies, or missing values present in the dataset. By thoroughly cleaning the data, we could proceed to the subsequent stages with confidence.</p>
									<p>Pivot Table Creation:
									After cleaning the data, we created a set of pivot tables. Pivot tables allowed us to efficiently summarize and aggregate the data, providing valuable insights into different aspects of bike sales.</p>
									<p>Insightful Visualizations:
									To present the findings in a more intuitive and visually appealing manner, we transformed the pivot table results into insightful visualizations. Utilizing various charts, graphs, and plots, we were able to effectively communicate patterns and trends within the data.</P>
									<p>Key Questions Addressed:
									Throughout the analysis, we sought to answer several key questions:
									1. Gender and Age Group Preferences: We investigated which gender and age groups showed a higher propensity for buying bikes. By analyzing the data, we could identify any preferences or variations in bike purchases across different demographics.</p>
									<p>2. Income and Region Analysis: Understanding the income levels and geographical regions of bike buyers was essential to tailor marketing strategies and target potential customers more effectively. We analyzed the dataset to determine the income distribution and identify regions with a higher demand for bikes.</p>
									<p>3. Influence of Car and House Ownership, and Presence of Children: We explored whether the ownership of cars and houses, as well as having children, influenced the decision to purchase a bike. This information provided valuable insights into the factors influencing the bike-buying behavior of customers.</p>
									<p>Conclusion:
									By conducting a comprehensive analysis and leveraging the power of Microsoft Excel, we were able to gain deep insights into the bike sales data. The project shed light on the preferences of different demographic groups, the impact of income and region on bike purchases, and the influence of car and house ownership, as well as having children. These findings can be instrumental in formulating marketing strategies, enhancing customer engagement, and optimizing business operations for the bike sale shop.
